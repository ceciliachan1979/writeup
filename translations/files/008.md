# 囚鳥

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| 我是被你囚禁的鳥 | I'm a bird trapped in your prison |
| 已經忘了天有多高 | I forgot how high the sky was |
| 如果離開你給我的小小城堡 | If I leave the tiny castle you built |
| 不知還有誰能依靠 | I really don't know whom to lean on |
| 我是被你囚禁的鳥 | I'm a bird trapped in your prison |
| 得到的愛來越來越少 | The love I've got is getting so thin |
| 看著你的笑在別人眼中燃燒 | Watched your smile blossom in the eyes of someone else |
| 我卻要不到一個擁抱 | I cannot even ask for a hug |
| 我像是一個你可有可無的影子 | I'm just a shadow that you don't even notice |
| 冷冷的看著你說謊的樣子 | Witness your cold while you're telling your lies |
| 這撩亂的城市 | The city is messed up |
| 容不下我的癡 | Passion is not accepted |
| 是什麼讓你這樣迷戀這樣的放肆 | What changed you like this passionate but dishonest with us |
| 我像是一個你可由可無的影子 | I'm just a shadow that you don't even notice |
| 和寂寞交換著悲傷的心事 | Only sadness knows what I am thinking |
| 對愛無計可施 | I am helpless with love |
| 這無味的日子 | These days are pale and tasteless |
| 眼淚是唯一的奢侈 | Oh tears would be my only luxury |
