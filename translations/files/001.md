# 白天不懂夜的黑

|                  |                                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 你永遠不懂我傷悲 | You just don't know of my sorrow           |
| 像白天不懂夜的黑 | The days don't know darkness of the nights |
| 像永恆燃燒的太陽 | Just like the burning sun above            |
| 不懂那月亮的盈缺 | Do not know the phases of the moon         |
