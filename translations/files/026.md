# 遺失的美好

|                        |                                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 我始終帶著你愛的微笑　 | I keep putting on the smile you always wanted  |
| 一路上尋找我遺失的美好 | Hunting for the beauty I had and now lost      |
| 不小心當淚劃過嘴角　　 | When my tears sneaked across my cheek          |
| 就用你握過的手抹掉　　 | I just wipe it with my hands you once held     |
| 再多的風景也從不停靠　 | My sail just won't stop for the abundant views |
| 只一心尋找我遺失的美好 | Keep hunting for the beauty that is still lost |
| 有的人說不清哪裡好　　 | Some may say what's the beauty in that         |
| 但就是誰都替代不了　　 | but no one can replace that for me.            |
