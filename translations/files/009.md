# 就算世界無童話

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| 願這世界如童話 | I wish the world is a fairy tale |
| 抱著想像實現它 | All I need is to imagine |
| 就憑摘星的手臂 | With my arms I can catch the stars |
| 為地球每夜放煙花 | And I serve the world with the fireworks |
| 就算世界無童話 | But if the world is not a fairy tale |
| 放下包袱完成它 | Let's unpack and work on our goals |
| 就來學攀山者有心不會怕… | As we climb there is nothing to be scared of |
