# 空凳

|                          |                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 獨望著空凳　　　　　　　 | Staring at the empty armchair alone      |
| 願我能再度和他促膝而坐　 | I wish we could sit together again       |
| 獨望著空凳心難過　　　　 | Bitterness comes with the staring of it  |
| 為何想講的從前不說清楚！ | Why didn't I tell him sooner.            |
| 曾懶說半句我愛他　　　　 | I was lazy to tell him I loved him.      |
| 懶說半句我愛他　　　　　 | Too lazy to do that.                     |
| 過去我說我最是要緊　　　 | I thought I mattered the most            |
| 今天發覺最愛他　　　　　 | But now I realize I loved him,           |
| 呼叫永遠也愛他　　　　　 | I swear I always loved him.              |
| 聽我叫喊只得一張空凳　　 | But now only the chair heard my screams. |
