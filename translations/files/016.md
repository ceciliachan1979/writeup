# First of May

|                                                 |                          |

| When I was small, and Christmas trees were tall | 話說細過，聖誕樹又高咗　 |
| We used to love while others used to play       | 你哋踢波，我哋去咗拍拖　 |
| Don't ask me why but time has passed us by      | 問你啊嚒，時間咁就過咗　 |
| Someone else moved in from far away             | 啊乜水，最近返咗香港 ⋯　 |
| Now we are tall and Christmas trees are small   | 就大過喎，棵樹好似矮咗　 |
| And you don't ask the time of day               | 而家幾點，咪問好喎　　　 |
| But you and I, our love will never die          | 其實你愛我，我只會愛更多 |
| But guess we'll cry come first of May           | 五月一喎，咪喊喇喎　　　 |
