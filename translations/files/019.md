# 風是冷

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| 風你慢行 | Breeze on the way |
| 請聽我問 | Listen to me |
| 你為誰消去 | Why did you move on? |
| 為誰而生 | For whom you came |
| 風裡著迷 | Fascinated |
| 相對發誓 | Swear by the wind |
| 我願隨風去 | I would follow it |
| 但覺風已逝 | But its now long gone |
| 他飄到過 | He passes by |
| 教我做夢 | Taught me to desire |
| 轉眼 | But then, |
| 他不告便去 | he sneaked away |
| 像是風 | So is the breeze |
| 風去復來 | The breeze come again |
| 他卻不在 | But he wasn't |
| 我在陽光裡 | Under the sunshine |
| 仍覺風是冷 | but the breeze is cold |
