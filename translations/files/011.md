# Those were the days

|                                              |                        |

| Once upon a time there was a tavern          | 從前在那邊有一家酒廊　 |
| Where we used to raise a glass or two        | 我們喝了一杯又一杯　　 |
| Remember how we laughed away the hours       | 還記得那些天和那些笑容 |
| Dreamed of all the great things we would do? | 做著那些要強大的夢　　 |
| Those were the days, my friend               | 朋友啊，往事啊　　　　 |
| We thought they'd never end                  | 快樂能永遠嗎　　　　　 |
| We'd sing and dance forever and a day        | 來吧唱吧來紛紛起舞吧　 |
| We'd live the life we choose                 | 活出我信念啊　　　　　 |
| We'd fight and never lose                    | 作戰吧，不會輸啊　　　 |
| For we were young and sure to have our way   | 年輕的心，總走出我路啊 |
