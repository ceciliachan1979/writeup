題目係[呢度](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-balanced-permutations/)

都在 comment 裏了。

        m1 = n
        m2 = m - n * ((p-r)//q)
        return (m1, m2, g)

    def countBalancedPermutations(self, num: str) -> int:
        #
        # Here are some trivial preprocessing
        #
        n = len(num)
        hist = [0] * 10
        sum = 0
        for ch in num:
            d = ord(ch) - ord('0')
            sum += d
            hist[d] += 1
        #
        # If the half sum is not an integer, we can return 0
        #
        if sum % 2 != 0:
            return 0

        half_sum = sum // 2
        half_count = n // 2

        #
        # Doing a DP similar to subset sum, to goal is to reach `half_sum` using exactly
        # `half_count` digits for the odd position.
        #
        # The basic subset sum is solved by the following
        #
        # Denote dp[sum] = 1 to mean sum is achievable, initially, only 0 is achievable
        #
        # Now for each element `X` in the set, for each current values such that dp[Y] is 1, 
        # dp[X + Y] is one as well.
        #
        # We will extend this in two ways.
        #
        # First, the solution above only solve the decision problem, to get to the actual subset, 
        # we can imagine dp[sum] stores the sets that achieve that instead. Now for each number
        # we can extend the sets and finally get to the sets that achieve the target sum.
        #
        # Second, we need to achieve the sum in a required number of steps. For that, we use dp[(sum,count)]
        # instead. That allow us to require the number of element used.
        #
        # With both of these tricks applied, now we can enumerate all the sets that achieve `half_sum` using 
        # exactly `half_count` digits.
        #
        # But that wasn't our goal, we need to count the number of permutations that works. For each set, there
        # is exactly (a+b+c)!/(a!b!c!) permutations for the odd positions if it has three different digits that 
        # occurs a,b,c times respectively.
        #
        # To understand the formula, imagine the repetitions are labelled, we can have (a+b+c)! distinct permutations
        # but then for every single one of them, there are a!b!c! of them that we identical because we can permute the
        # same digit without being different.
        #
        # Using modular arithmetic, we can rewrite that as (a+b+c)! inv(a!) inv(b!) inv(c!), 
        #
        # The final solution is the sum of the number of odd permutation times the number of even permutation over all
        # feasible subsets.
        # 
        # As a sum of product, we can factorize. The (a+b+c) part turns out must be identical for all feasible subsets
        # so we can just factor that out
        # The interesting part is obviously the factorial inverses
        # 
        # While they are not the same for all feasible subsets, they still agree if they have the same prefix, so
        # we can extend it just like we extend the feasible subsets
