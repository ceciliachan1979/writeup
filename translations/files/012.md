| He's got to find her.                                                                                          | 他要尋　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 |
| He already knew, there's no one else for him but she.                                                          | 他明白，沒有人，就是她　　　　　　　　　 |

| He looked everywhere; hundreds of times, thousands of times, endless times...                                  | 這裏，那裏，無數遍　　　　　　　　　　　 |
| Still, he keeps looking, he keeps looking more; and he keeps looking more.                                     | 他堅持，他繼續，剎那回頭望見了　　　　　 |
| Suddenly, he turns, and sees her.                                                                              | 她在那影子下，一直，等他。　　　　　　　 |
| She is in the shadow, all along, waiting for him.                                                              | 等他的回眸，等他看見她的等待　　　　　　 |
| Waiting for him to turn around to see her, to see her there waiting for him                                    | 就是一直等，一直等他轉身　　　　　　　　 |
| She keeps waiting for that someday he will turn around to find her...                                          | 然後他就真的轉身了，在這偌大的人海中遇見 |
| And he did! Finally found!! They finally found each other in this big wide huge world, this time is for keeps. | 剎那就是永恒　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 |
