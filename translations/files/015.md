# 分身術

|         |         |
|---------|---------|
| 一出街 能重遇你不禁心中暗喜 | Just got out, I was pleased that I ran into you |
| 一轉身 為何又有一個分身的你 | Look around, why did I run into another you |
| 這裡有你 那裡有你 | Here is you, there were you |
| 每個途人亦似足從前的你 | It seems everyone is just another you |
| 彷彿將 藏在下意識中黑盒揭起 | Unconsciously, opened the hidden Pandora box |
| 鎖起的 舊愛記憶集體傾巢逃離 | Locked up, lovely memories flushing out through the door |
| 四百個你 八百個你 | Here is you, there were you |
| 企滿行人路裡 步步露殺機 | Surrounded by you, traps are everywhere |
| 無謂太過 我欠你什麼這麼迫我 | Oh that's enough, did I really owe you that much |
| 你不是那一天 已撇下我麼 | Didn't you ditch me alone on another day |
| 還是我 被害後幻像太多 | Or is it, too much traumatic vision |
| 怎麼我眼內 人人像你 人人是你 | In my view everyone looks like you, you are everyone |
| 沿途萬里 完全被封鎖 | Locked up this way, all over the world |
| 前方街角尚有幾多個 | Around the corner there were you again |
| 徘徊著 未散的 靈魂在共我拍拖 | Surrounding, keep stalking, your spirit is dating with me |
| 你的分身 怎麼緊貼著我 | All of you just keep sticking with me |
| 到底真的假的經已混和 | I can't tell the truth from just the vision |
| 還是以前的事 不捨得的一個是我 | It was all the past, it was me who don't just let it go. |
